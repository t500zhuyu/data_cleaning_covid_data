This a data cleaning and queries using Microsoft SQL Server
The data set is from: https://ourworldindata.org/

In this script I use different statements to check and analyze info.
SQL keywords are like:
 - select from
 - where
 - order by
 - MAX
 - SUM
 - JOIN
 - DROP
 - Insert Into

Using CTE (Common Table Expression)
